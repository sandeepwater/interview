1st Round

Write a program to count a frequency of word from a given string s=" This is is name name" and store them in map using java 8 stream api.
WAP to find given two string is isomophic or not.
WAP to find the first index of given target from a given sorted non-decreasing array.
Ex: array a = [-2, -1, 3, 3, ,3, 10,10,10,23], target = 10
output = 5;
You have to do this in log(n) time complexity.
